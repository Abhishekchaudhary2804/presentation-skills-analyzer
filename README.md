Presentation & Communication Skills Analyzer

A real-time computer vision system that analyzes presentation skills using webcam or recorded video.
The system evaluates eye contact, posture, hand gestures, and overall confidence, then generates a CSV session log and PDF performance report with improvement tips.

Built using Python + OpenCV + MediaPipe Tasks API.

🚀 Features

✅ Live webcam or recorded video support
✅ Eye contact / gaze stability analysis
✅ Posture & slouch detection
✅ Hand gesture usage scoring
✅ Overall confidence score (0–100)
✅ Rule-based improvement tips
✅ Session CSV export
✅ Automated PDF report generation

🧠 Skill Metrics

The system computes:

Eye Contact Score

Posture Score

Gesture Score

Confidence Score

Confidence is calculated as:

Confidence = 0.4 × Eye + 0.3 × Posture + 0.3 × Gesture

💡 Example Improvement Tips

Increase eye contact with camera

Straighten posture and reduce slouch

Use more natural hand gestures

🎯 Use Cases

Presentation practice

Interview preparation

Public speaking improvement

Soft-skills analytics demo

🏆 Resume Description

Built a real-time Presentation Skills Analyzer using Python, OpenCV and MediaPipe Tasks API to evaluate eye contact, posture, gestures and confidence, generating automated CSV and PDF performance reports.

🔮 Future Improvements

Audio speaking pace analysis

ML classifier (confident / nervous / distracted)

Web dashboard

Historical session comparison


📈 Evaluation Notes

Eye contact estimated using iris center approximation.

Posture calculated via shoulder alignment and head forward distance.

Hand gestures measured using wrist movement across frames.

Scores are rule-based and not ML-trained.

Lighting and camera angle affect accuracy.

Designed for single-person frontal presentation.
